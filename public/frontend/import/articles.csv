59,Transportation,Cab,,4943,[Satisfaction Achat][Grab],Oui,Achat,12/31/2017,Lavender,Grab,,,Carpooling,"Today I took my Mother from lavender to Jurong west to visit a doctor for her joint injection, this was our second injection, thanks to grab, the ride was smooth, the driver was caring for our safety to drive us into the carpark to let us alight. Because of the $5 I was able save much considering the trip was Long and I got to spent much on the injection. 

Then it rained the whole day and barely 15mins to 12 noon, the fare jumped from $9.50 to $22! (Grab share) we got to sit outside the clinic waiting for the price to come down since it was only drizzling! We wasted about 45 mins then finally paid $14 after discount to go home. While picking up another passenger, we waited some 4 mins, the driver called the lady said she's walking to the pick up point but came a foul-smelling man wearing sunglasses on a rainy day. I saw the driver stealing a few glances at the weird passenger while driving us to my flat. 

After lunch I took another trip to my friend's house and a BMW grab car pick me up but there's no other passenger sharing. The driver took very Long to come and took rather Long to send me to my destination, I what's app my location to my Friend and she said that's too far from her house so I asked the driver, is it that the GPS direct you a longer route? He replied,"" The GPS hang and I missed the turn."" ""Oh! No wonder as my place is actually near my friend's house."" 

Then in the evening I left my friend's house, using grab share too, price surge a bit but still slightly cheaper, it was still drizzling as it was raining the entire day. Today my total grabshare fare was $31.50 for total 4 trips after discount of $20! I had never spent so much on taxi fare in just one day! But I really appreciate the discount given and provides me so much convenience! Still, I wish the $5 discount won't run out for me when I needed it most especially nowadays the $5 promotion runs out fast even just after 6pm or 7.30pm!",4,1,1/2/18 0:14,1/2/18 10:34,Grab,Grab
